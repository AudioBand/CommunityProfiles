    "Description": "(font requires install) Smaller/more compact version of ariccb's Spotify Style Refined, with spotify native font, icons, and colours. Based on dark theme but shouldn't be too hard to modify for light theme. I included the font in the assets folder so you can install and use it if you'd like :)",
